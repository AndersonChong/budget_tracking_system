# Budget tracking System :moneybag:

This system is designed and built specifically for my **university in-course assignment**. In a team of 4, we aimed to create a **budget tracking mobile application** that provides some core functionalities to the users like __income & expense tracking__, __budget tracking__, __statistic report__, __account selection__, and __currency selection & conversion__.

## Language Used in this System :pencil2:

**Dart with flutter framework**. Flutter provides the required tools to create multi-platform application easily. But for this project, we only focuses on creating **Android mobile platform**.
